module: lagoon.api.cmdb_diff
short_description: Compare local and remote Lagoon configuration states
description:
  - This module compares local configuration states (head) against the remote states tracked in Lagoon (base).
  - It ensures configuration integrity by displaying discrepancies in the Ansible output, highlighting configurations that will be updated or removed based on the differences detected.
  - The module supports 'strict' and 'key' comparison modes to allow for detailed or general comparisons as needed.
options:
  head:
    description:
      - A list representing the expected local state of configuration variables.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: dict

    description:
      - A list representing the remote state of configuration variables as tracked in Lagoon.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: dict
  ignore:
    description:
      - A list of variable names to ignore during the comparison, preventing unnecessary updates.
    required: false
    type: list
    elements: str
  mode:
    description:
      - Specifies the mode of comparison. Options are 'strict' for complete equality checks, or 'key' for targeted attribute comparisons.
    required: false
    type: str
    choices: ['strict', 'key']
  keys:
    description:
      - Required when mode is 'key'. A list of keys to focus the comparison on, improving specificity and relevance of the diff output.
